_For o2 Germany_

This script can automatically bruteforce the birthdate required for sim card activation

I made this because I mistyped my birthdate during registration but didn't want to deal with their support. Turns out you have unlimited attempts.

Just run `php bruteforceo2.php`

Maybe you need to grab new cookies from their site and add them as headers to the script.
